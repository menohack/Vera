README

I'm creating my own little folder as a playground, as I seem to be running into issues when I try to alter the given file structure. It's a huge mess at this point though, and there seem to be a lot of dependencies, so we should really prioritize cleaning it up and removing those file structure based dependencies after this weeks demo. It isn't fun work, but this kind of problem only grows as a project gets bigger so we need to do it sooner rather than later.
